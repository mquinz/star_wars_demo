## Training Notes

The hands-on exercises use instructions and datasets that are available in this repo.

The Powerpoint slides will be available for download from the same repo shortly.

This session will be recorded.  It is the first time much of this material will be used in a training session so a recording will be very useful for us to improve for the next iteration.

## AuraDB
We will be using a free developer instance of AuraDB for this session.
Each participant should have their own instance, but it is okay if you share the instance that I've created for the class.

I will post the URL and the credentials in the Zoom chat.
